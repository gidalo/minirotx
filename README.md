Introduction to the New Retrogames Cabinet with Screen Rotation System

We are excited to introduce our new Retrogames Cabinet featuring an innovative screen rotation system, designed for retro gaming enthusiasts. 
This device combines the charm of classic arcade machines with modern technology, delivering a more immersive and customizable gaming experience.

At the core of the system is the powerful and compact Raspberry Pi Zero, running on the RetroPie platform, providing access to a wide array of retro games. 
The true standout feature, however, is the 2.8" display with a rotating mechanism, allowing easy transitions between vertical and horizontal orientations. 
This feature is perfect for optimizing gameplay across a variety of titles, from classic shoot 'em ups to beloved platformers.

The cabinet also includes an integrated audio system, ensuring clear and immersive sound to enhance the nostalgic gaming atmosphere. 
Whether you're looking to relive arcade magic or discover new classic titles, this cabinet offers the perfect fusion of the past and present, making it an ideal choice for any retro gaming fan.
